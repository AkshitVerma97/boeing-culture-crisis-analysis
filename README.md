## The Business Problem
**"How did an engineering giant known for safety lose its way?"**

Following the 737 MAX tragedies, Boeing faced a collapse in public trust, regulatory scrutiny, and a mass exodus of engineering talent. Our objective was to diagnose the **root managerial causes**—beyond just the technical failures—and propose a restructuring plan to restore engineering excellence.

---

## The Diagnosis (Root Cause Analysis)
We identified three critical failures in Boeing's organizational behavior:

### 1. The Erosion of "Psychological Safety"
* **Observation:** Engineers feared retaliation for raising safety concerns.
* **Impact:** Critical design flaws (MCAS) were suppressed to meet aggressive production deadlines.
* **Concept:** *Groupthink* and *Silence vs. Voice*.

### 2. Motivational Misalignment (Expectancy Theory)
* **Observation:** Executive incentives were tied strictly to stock price and delivery speed, not safety outcomes.
* **The Breakdown:** Engineers learned that *Effort (Safety Checks)* $\neq$ *Reward (Promotion)*. In fact, safety checks were punished as "delays."

### 3. Leadership Drift
* **Observation:** A shift from "Engineering-First" leadership to "Finance-First" management.
* **Impact:** Leaders lacked the technical literacy to understand the risks they were approving.

## Strategic Framework: The "Vicious Cycle"
*We mapped the breakdown of employee motivation using Vroom's Expectancy Theory. When safety protocols are punished rather than rewarded, the "Instrumentality" link breaks.*

## The Turnaround Strategy (Recommendations)
Our proposed **"Engineering-First" Restructuring Plan** focuses on three pillars:

**1. Leadership Reform (The "Who")**
* **Action:** Replace "Transactional" leaders with "Transformational" leaders who have engineering backgrounds.
* **Metric:** Tie 40% of executive bonuses to **Safety & Quality Metrics** (not just EPS).

**2. Governance Redesign (The "How")**
* **Action:** Re-establish the "Dissent Channel." Create a direct reporting line from Safety Engineers to the Board of Directors, bypassing middle management.

**3. Cultural Realignment**
* **Action:** Implement a **"No-Fault" Reporting System** (similar to the FAA's ASRS) where reporting errors is rewarded, creating a culture of psychological safety.
